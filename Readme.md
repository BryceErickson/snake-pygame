CS115 -- Spring 2022 -- Project 3

Introduction

describe the problem you are solving or data you are exploring or game you are writing in this project. The game that I choose to make was the snake game. It is such a basic game that I have not played in so long and I thought it was interesting. I also really enjoy playing video games and making one has always been something I wanted to do.

List of files

README.md - this file. The purpose of this file is to provide an overview of the project and reflect on the work done.
Dependencies

All you will need is a computer that will allow you to run and open the game window. Replit is free and works for playing this form of the snake game.

How to run your project

explain how to run your project and from where. Do I run it from the command line? If so, what do I type? Do I run it in a notebook? What file do I look at first? All you have to do to run this code is "python main.py". A game window should appear and you will be able to play the snake game. The most important file is main.py and then the other two just define the snake and the food.

Summary

#Summary - The project that I choose to use is how to make the snake game. The point of the game is to play with a snake and eat food with the snake and see how long you can live without dying. You will die if you run into the wall or into your own tail. To play this game all you have to do is lauch it py typing "python main.py" Then the window of the game will appear and you will be able to play the game using the arrows on your keyboard. I choose this because I do really enjoy video games and did not realize I could do it using python. I used the turtorial that replit gives on how to build the snake game because I would not even know what to do. I found it iteresting that we had to define so much just for the game. Also something that I was familiar with was loops in the code. We used the loop to make sure the food would respawn and you could keep playing.

References

list all of the resources you used to complete this project and give a brief description of what you used that resource for. I expect to see a main resource that contains the tutorial you followed, but there should be other items for exploring different tools or for learning about certain tools or concepts.

My main source was https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/19-build-snake-with-pygame. This is the link do the How to build a snake game.

I also used https://replit.com/@EMarie28/Snake-Game just to see what other codes of the same game would look like.
